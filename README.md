# Welcome to Ed's application
It promises to be preachy vexing and decidedly un-funny.

First of all I am unable to entertain your challenge, because I find laughing, humor and happiness in general objectionable.

I appreciate the intention behind the pull request challenge as a demonstration of skills. However, I have concerns. Balancing numerous applications demands efficiency, and dedicating more than an hour per challenge isn't feasible.  
Moreover, the public nature of the repository permits potential "borrowing" from past pull requests, potentially not showcasing genuine skills.   
My extensive professional experience provides a deeper understanding of my abilities than a single task.  
While the challenge may indicate desire for this role, it might not fully capture a candidate's overall software engineering acumen. I humbly suggest a consideration of my broader track record as a comprehensive assessment.

You will find a detailed write up of past personal projects and work experience on my [personal website](https://eduardkieser.github.io/) and examples of my personal professional style [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0&ab_channel=Duran).
